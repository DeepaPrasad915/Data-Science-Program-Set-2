# Data-Science-Program-Set-2
Pre-Processing Techniques programs and KNN algorithm!!!!
--> The programs is demonstrate on the techniques of pre-processing
--> Quantile ----which means it is used to spilt the values from datasets into equal parts.
--> MinMaxScaler ------It is used for min and max values from the datasets.
--> Z_Scores----It is statistical measurment which is used to indicated a data point away from mean of dataset.
This all techniques are used for remove the outliers of data model, using the array and dataframe including the library of numpy, pandas, scipy etc
Include the programs on KNN Classifiers Algorithms:
Using the library of KKN classifiers and functions-----KNN Is used for classifiction the data by identifying the models based on thier features.
